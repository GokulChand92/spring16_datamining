PROJECT TITLE: Climate Data Online (CDO)

OVERVIEW -

Climate Data online or "CDO" provides access to climate data products through a simple, searchable online web mapping service.
Users can find a variety of products, reports via CDO including the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily and the new 1981-2010 Annual, Monthly and Daily 30-year Normals. CDO puts a priority on interpreting and applying scientific understanding to our extensive array of climate datasets. Some of the products and output derived from this effort include extreme event and dynamically generated climate information.

DATA -

All data we have taken is be openly available (obtained from public/open systems). We have taken a datset from WWW.DATA.GOV which gives a
detailed description about Climate Normals, monthly climate reports, and drought information, analyses of weather and climate events, increasingly comparing recent events to expectations of future climate conditions, information detailing extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, tornadoes, and hurricanes have affected the United States since the dawn of time and climate information generated from examination of the data in the archives includes record temperatures, record precipitation and snowfall, climate extremes statistics.

Some climate data online APIS are used to obtain this data for users in variety of formats such as CSV, XML, JSON.

RESEARCH ANALYSIS -

The climate of the United States varies by location and by time of year. Our Project motivation is to bring Climate Normals,
monthly climate reports, and drought information are a few of the many datasets and products found under one climate section. So users can easily get a publicly access to our web service 'CDO' and get the data in a variety of formats such as CSV, XML, JSON.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT -

Our Project team includes 3 members and our roles and contributions are following

Vamsi Krishna : Data set required for project. Gokul : Data Analysis, Classification and Data testing. Venkateswara R Alluri(Optional) : Reporting the final data documentation.
